# Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

project:
  name: Student Performance Analytics Dashboard
  description: >
    The Student Performance Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard
    designed to analyze and visualize student performance data efficiently.
    It helps educators track individual and section-wide performance, identify trends,
    and make data-driven decisions.

features:
  - Section Overview: Insights on average marks, pass/fail rates, and subject performance.
  - Individual Performance: Student-specific analysis with SGPA trends, subject marks, and result breakdowns.
  - CIE vs. SEE Analysis: Visual comparison of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) and Semester End Examination (SEE) scores.
  - Dynamic Slicers: Filter data by Batch, Semester, USN, and Subjects.
  - Real-time Data Updates: Data updates automatically when new records are added.

tech_stack:
  - Power BI: Interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
  - MySQL: Data storage and retrieval.
  - Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy): Data preprocessing and automation.
  - Streamlit: UI for CSV uploads to MySQL.
  - GitHub: Version control and collaboration.
